# Hello

Hello, my name is Wahyu Pelita Jaya. i am currently a worker in the field of animal health and at the same time a student of public administration. i like to explore various things in the field of computers and currently I am focusing on data and want to become a data analyst. although my current major is not IT but previously I have studied for 3 years in computer and network engineering during vocational high school, and briefly took a computer science study program for 2 semesters at one of the private universities in Indonesia. i am always eager and willing to continue learning new things, including programming for data analysis. Feel free to use anything from my repository and let's learn and grow together.
